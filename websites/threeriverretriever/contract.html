        <h2>Three River Retrievers Purchase Agreement</h2>

        <p><strong>Thank you for purchasing one of our puppies!</strong></p>
        <p>This Agreement is written for the protection of both the breeder and the buyer; however, it is primarily written to protect the health and general well-being of the puppy. This is a Purchase Agreement that will need to be signed and returned prior to you taking possession of your Golden Retriever puppy.</p>

        <h3>1. Deposit and Hold</h3>
        <p>Buyer is making a NON-REFUNDABLE deposit (unless one of the following conditions occurs). This can be made using cash, check mailed to the address listed on the agreement or Venmo.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Litter is not conceived</li>
            <li>Unavailable due to health concerns, or death prior to owner’s possession.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the deposit of $200 has been received and the agreement has been signed, your puppy will be reserved. If for any reason the purchaser decides to no longer purchase or take possession of the puppy, the deposit is forfeited, except for the reasons listed above. After the puppy reaches eight (8) weeks of age, the owner will need to pay in full by using cash, Venmo/or Zelle (unless other arrangements have been previously made with Breeder). If the buyer fails to take possession by week 9, the $200 deposit will be forfeited unless previous arrangements are made (see additional charges).</p>
        
        <!-- Initials Section -->
        <div class="mb-3">
            <label for="initials" class="form-label">Initial here after reading and agreeing to the "Deposit and Hold" section:</label>
            <input type="text" class="form-control" id="initials" placeholder="Enter your initials" required>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Deposit Transfer to Future Litters</h3>
        <p>This deposit will be transferable to a future litter upon one of the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unavailability of puppy due to a health condition, including death of puppy.</li>
            <li>Unavailability of puppy due to gender preference.</li>
            <li>Personal preference/issues arise, and Buyer cannot take the puppy at the specified (8) weeks of age. TRR (Three River Retrievers) does not want the Buyer to take possession of a puppy they cannot care for in fear of losing their deposit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Payment Methods</h3>
        <p>If payment is being made by cash, Venmo, or Zelle the total remaining balance can be paid on the day the Buyer takes possession of the puppy.</p>
        <p>If the payment is being made by personal check, you will need to allow ten (10) business days. Please mail to address listed on purchase agreement. Check must clear 48 hours prior to Buyer taking possession of puppy.</p>

        <h3>4. Puppy Charges and Potential Additional Charges</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>$1,250 is the total price of the puppy (including the deposit) – to receive a puppy with FULL AKC (breeding rights) registration.</li>
            <li>$1,000 is the price of the puppy (including the deposit) for limited registration.</li>
            <li>$10 per day boarding fee beginning at the age of 9 weeks if the Buyer does not or cannot take possession of the puppy once the puppy has reached the eight (8) weeks of age unless TRR is unavailable during this time to transfer the puppy.</li>
            <li>For an additional charge of $100 you can have the pick of the litter by color/sex/size.</li>
            <li>In person visits will not be allowed until the puppies are 6 weeks of age.</li>
            <li>Delivery charges may apply.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Condition/Care of Your Puppy</h3>
        <p>Your puppy will be up to date on shots and deworming at the time of pick up. It is very important that you continue the vaccinations and deworming. Please do not expose your puppy to other dogs that are not vaccinated until he/she has completed the entire vaccination schedule. This usually takes place between 12-16 weeks although please check with your veterinarian for guidance.</p>

        <h3>6. Meeting and Picking Out Your Puppy</h3>
        <p>Pictures available at 4 weeks (or sooner if possible). Meet and pick out your puppy at 6 weeks by appointment. We ask that any other animals be left at home or in the vehicle.</p>

        <h3>7. Delivery and Transfer of Puppy</h3>
        <p>The transfer of the puppy to the Buyer will take place when full payment has been made and cleared. The puppy will be registered with the AKC, and all necessary documentation will be provided. The puppy will be in good health at the time of delivery. Delivery charges may apply depending on the distance from the breeder's location.</p>

        <h3>Agreement Statement</h3>
        <p>This contract is made and signed by both Three River Retrievers and Buyer to ensure the protection of the puppy.</p>
